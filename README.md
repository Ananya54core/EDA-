ðŸ©º Medical Data EDA - Insights Through Exploratory Data Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on medical data, using Python's powerful data analysis and visualization libraries. The goal of this project is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights within the medical dataset to better understand health-related factors and outcomes.

Features
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to prepare the dataset for analysis.
Statistical Analysis: Summary statistics, distribution analysis, and correlation checks to understand relationships between variables.
Data Visualization: Utilizing libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create insightful visualizations that highlight key trends and patterns.
Feature Engineering: Creating new variables and transforming existing ones to improve the analytical depth of the dataset.
Hypothesis Testing: Conducting statistical tests to validate or refute assumptions about the data.
Python Libraries Used
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: To handle numerical operations and data structures.
Matplotlib: For basic plotting and data visualization.
Seaborn: For advanced and aesthetically pleasing statistical visualizations.
Plotly: To create interactive plots and dashboards.
SciPy: For performing statistical tests and analyses.
